	description "Standing for Light Emitting Neutron Star, the LENS seems to be siblings with the Multipurpose Fractal Engine and even potentially the jump drive. Like them, no one can completely understand how it works, but the best that any Tuxen scientist has been able to figure out is that slight guidances to the star's gravity field give a significant amount of thrust. Its results are so profound that no other engines are ever needed, and also is a ridiculously small outfit size. The purplish light emitted from it is mixed with stray ions and are what comes out of your engine mounts. Somehow, the shunned Tuxen have harnessed this power for their own devastating purposes."
