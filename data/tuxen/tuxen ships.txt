	description "The Shunned Tuxen didn't bring any shipbuilders to Ritala, so they have been forced (not that they mind) to steal Tuxen interceptors. However, without proper maintenence and care, these ships have a tendency to degrade, one that the shunned Tuxen tend to glance over."

	description "Given that this is a giant leaf branch from a distant Tuxen forest world made space-worthy, it has a suprising amount of heft behind it. While not having quite as good a shield matrix that similarly sized ships have, it makes up for it in cargo and outfit space. Gun ports and turret mounts are mounted on seemingly every branch, making it a force to be reckoned with. Since the ship is quasi-organic, it has built in hull repair, backed up by an already impressive hull.
