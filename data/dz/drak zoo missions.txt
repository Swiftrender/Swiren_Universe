You are escorted with haste up a few dozen floors, and emerge from the elevator directly into a conference room. After a brief wait, you meet the Republican government head officials. As everyone is getting settled, a familar face quietly walks in and takes a seat. You wave to Admiral Danforth with a smile, then get to business.`
