# Note - I recommend turning Word Wrap off, to make viewing the change heirarchy easier.

v1.7.1
	Changes
		Map
			Fixed some stray naming issues that would spawn systems in the middle of the map.

v1.7
	Notes
		After a long time away, I'm back for some amount of time.
	Changes
		Map
			Renamed some systems. Naming one "2" was a very dumb choice.
		Outfits
			Changed values of some Special type outfits.

v1.6.13
	Additions
		Sound
			Ambient
				- Added three loop tracks to Swiren Station, Hub World, and Letaga. Their respective mood fits them, I think. Credit goes to Jackbox Games (jackboxgames.bandcamp.com) for the three soundtracks, which are used in the game Word Spud.
	Changes
		Assorted
				- Changed a small integer that had previously set an `interface` image in the wrong place.
				- Fixed a minor typo relating to Swiren Station.
	Notes
		Tuxen
			- It's been awhile since I've touched these files, so I'm not sure if I've mentioned the following yet, and I'm too lazy to go back and look.
			- Since Taely is a prefect, it would make sense for her to have a veritable escort. If I don't want to do that, who else has a formidable knowledge of technology and has had alien encounters?
			- While looking back through the previous plugin versions, it occured to me that I need to remember that your first experience with a Tuxen is with Bi'tux. Even though the original mission sequence is trashed, OGs will remember Bi'tux. "You must hurry, human, with utmost haste!"
		Random
			- Note to self to add charity missions to the plugin. All it is is you're paying some planet that's in need, but it slightly boosts the reputation of whatever the presiding government is. I feel like this is something that could be implemented into vanilla?

v1.6.12
	Additions
		- Tuxen
			- Added some more to TX1-2
	Changes
		- Tuxen
			- Renamed the Shunned Tuxen homeworld and linked it with the rest of the surrounding systems. This'll be interesting.
	Notes
		- The version numbers for this plugin change so frequently because I transfer the folder between two computers. Renaming versions helps differentiate what's new and what's old.
v1.6.11
	Additions
		- Tuxen
			- FINALLY (I think) FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO `label` AND `goto` STUFF! Honestly, I think it was just me not paying enough attention to how the vanilla missions were spaced and tabbed, and my missions were confusing the parser. I'd like to thank mission "Remnant: Learn Sign 1" for being the mission that helped me figure it all out. When I'm rich and famous, I'll remember you.
			- Just did a complicated `choice` sequence that involves 9 potential choices (funneling into one outcome). I think I'm safe in saying I've gotten the hang of mission writing. I forgive you, MZ!
			- As much as the player will hate this, the only logical way to get into the Tuxen computer is by contacting Taely. She's head of reverse engineering blah blah blah, and is really the only person that could deal with this kind of alien tech.
				- Maybe make different branches where the player can choose between Taely, x,y, and z characters? And have unique storylines up until you return them to where you picked them up.

v1.6.10
	Additions
		- Tuxen
			- Working on a new `missions.txt` file to replace the hurried, incomplete current one.
				- Am pretty much set on making them a hive mind (interruption - while the Kor Sestor and Mereti are technically hive minds, it's not sentient)
					- Wondering how obtaining a license will be possible - unless the main point of this storyline is to be at war with them - no outfitters etc and stealing their ships
					- Is this unique? I personally haven't seen it before
			- NTS that Letaga eventually needs to dip and be "sucked in" by the black hole, in an `event`
	Changes
		- Various
			- Took a brief look through some files and made corrections.
	Notes
		- Space Arena
			- Wondering if adding ships like the Kupoint and Tlano are really necessary. While they look cool, they don't really add anything to the plugin, and don't really have any kind of explanation as to why they're added.
				- I really like those names, so I'll keep them in mind for anything else I might add.
		- I've been in constant doubt about the update numbering. Was v1.0.0 really the best I could offer for a first release? Might start renaming the updates? Or will v2.0.0 be the start of a new update numbering system, once I have the individual plugin aspects fully written?
		- Reminding myself to take a breath and re-do the Tuxen storyline. It may seem like a daunting task, but one I must undertake nonetheless. It's way too rushed right now. Instead of having the Tuxen pop out of nowhere, maybe make them shy at first?
			- Maybe having them as a hive mind isn't so crazy now. I haven't forgotten.
			- Also personal reminder to make the 'ui' for Tuxen space something that only shows up when you first go through the wormhole.

v1.6.9
	- Ha ha yes funny number
	Additions
		- Assorted
			- This file now contains much more than a few misc planets - it's where `interface` code is placed among other things. Now, when the player starts up the game, a customized main menu appears. The only thing beside this is the `boarding panel` ui interface, but I'll probably add more to this later.
	Notes
		- Had a revalation. Was always so starstruck at people that made mods for other games, like Minecraft, for example - but I'm now realizing that all these other games that support mods/plugins are JUST THE SAME as what I'm doing here. ES is the foundation, Swiren Universe is just another floor built upon the ES building. This property applies to Minecraft and all the other games. Actually considering making a Forge mod now lol
		- Wondering what attribute an outfit needs to be unsellable.

v1.6.8
	Additions
		Drak Zoo
			- Struggling my way through DZ5. Making multiple options in the form of `labels` and `gotos` still somehow elude me. And looking in existing vanilla mission files DOES not help, because it's almost never written consistently. Weird.
	To Come
		- Personal reminder to make use of the random image files I've collected. Maybe actually do something with them?

v1.6.7
	Additions
		Root Files
			- Added some fun `ui` and `_menu` additions.
	Notes
		- What makes a jump drive a jump drive? In what file is the "lets you jump to any nearby system" located? Trying to make a "Warp Drive." Grrr this is annoying.
			- Found it! Of course(!), it's in the .exe, so it'd be impossible to add to the plugin. Wish this could be remedied.

v1.6.6
	Additions
		Drak Zoo
			- Missions written:
				- DZ4
			- Missions WIP:
				- DZ5
	To Come
		Drak Zoo
			- I've got to figure out how to write a mission chain that makes it appear as if you're asking a question from a menu, that question is answered, then you return to the menu with one less option, as if you're proceeding through the options. This is done in a mission chain I can't remember...

v1.6.5
	Additions
		Quarg
			- Added some short descriptions to the Quarg outfits that normally don't have one. Might make a PR for the vanilla game.
		Drak Zoo
			- Missions written:
				- DZ3
			- Missions WIP:
				- DZ4
	Notes
		- Got some feedback on the Drak Zoo missions. Seems like this would never be implemented into the vanilla game? I can sort of understand that, but I feel like SOMETHING needs to happen with the Drak, instead of them always being a mystery species.
		- Also now thinking what else I could do, however minor, that would fit in, be canon, whatever.

v1.6.4
	Additions
		Drak Zoo
			- Started a whole new mission sequence. Read the README.txt entry to learn more.
				- Missions written:
					- DZ1
					- DZ2
				- Missions WIP:
					- DZ3
					- DZ4
	Changes
		Root Files
			- Not technically an update, but I've sorted the data files and renamed the plugin to Swiren Universe. It's now inspired by Shields Up, in a way.

v1.6.3
	Additions
		Space Arena
			- Wrote Waves:
				- 14
	Notes
		- Changed version to 1.6.3 to differentiate between older versions.

v1.6.2
	Additions
		Root Files
			- Piled all the loose outfits, planets, etc (such as Top Hat, Confederacy, etc) into `assorted.txt`
			- Also added the proper copyright files. If you want to shoot me an email, go ahead! I'm always willing to take feedback and constructive criticism.
			- Re-did `icon.png` for the third time. It's now my official icon, one I recently developed.
	Changes
		Space Arena
			- Slight tweaks and alterations for a better experience.
				- This includes DOUBLING the number of ships in each wave except for final boss. Through my testing, the first thirteen waves that I coded were supremely easy for the tester ship I used. My shields never got below 75%.
	To Come
		Space Arena
			- Y'know, it'd be helpful if I actually made a refueling station in Wave Nine, wouldn't it?
		Effects
			- Note to self to redo the plugins' ship's explosion file to the `cartoon` one.
		Map
			- Here's a thought - make "Helpful Wormholes" that connect one end of the galaxy to the next
v1.6.1
	Additions
		Governments
			- Added a "Hub World" government so the player doesn't have any trouble landing repeatedly, but still gets attacked by the waves.
		Missions
			- Added a warning in case the player doesn't read the about or README files.
	Changes
		Map
			- Finally copied the Tuxen and SA systems to their own respective map.txt files. A lot of people had been wanting this, and while I had planned to do it in the future, just got over myself and did it.
		Root Files
			- Changed the plugin icon to the Top Hat outfit image, because I was lazy and thought it looked neat. Still might change it again, who knows.
		Outfits
			- Developer Drive
				- Finally removed it since it was too much of a pain to use in the various tester ships I created during the course of SA
	To Come
		Ships
			- Tlano
				- I already have most of the components together for this ship, but there's still a few thing I have to work out.
		Missions
			- Not technically a mission, but it's coded as such. Make a `landing` mission that explains the basics of both aspects of the plugin, if the player hasn't read README.txt or about.txt. It's kind of important.
		Space Arena
			- Considering splitting each wave's mission in to two parts, to make it so players can click on the mission and have it autonav to the system, instead of the player having to do it manually. I don't think it would be too hard to do this?
			- Also, I should probably make the `galaxy` icons for SA appear procedurally, like the alien faction ones - kinda ruins the effect a bit maybe of seeing all the systems at once
			- Because of that one plugin I found that gives reputation etc, maybe make missions available on Hub World that reopen the waves? Very small profit but I think I should do it - or make them all open at once (by default or by a singular mission)?
	Notes
			- There wasn't too much significant reason to move to a new version, but complications with duplicate files arose, after sticking with v1.6.0 for too long.
			- I've noticed a potential bug in ship pricing. What I have in `tuxen ships.txt` does not at all correspond to what's shown in game. Conflicting data/files, or 0.9.12 bug?

v1.6.0 - Ships Expansion
	Additions
		Ships
			- "Bush" - Tuxen cargo freighter
		Root Files
			- Sounds
				- Added a sound for the Radial Hex Field
	To Come
		Missions
			- After a good deal of feedback from the ES Discord, I've decided to completely revamp the Tuxen First Contact missions. Mainly, I'll make it so the introduction isn't so rushed.
			- Note to self to make sure that you can't complete Tuxen missions if you have a negative reputation with them, to prevent you from obtaining their ships and outfits legit early on
		Outfits
			- Am also considering actually making Medium Stomata Thrusters now. There was a point where they would have been irrelevant, but it's becoming an increasing issue, as I'm going to be making more Tuxen ships.

v1.5.1
	Changes
		Missions
			- Space Arena
				- Fixed a bug where new Wave systems didn't show up on the map		
	Additions
		Events
			- Space Arena
				- Added a `visit` trigger to each event so the player can find each new wave system
	To Come
		Ships
			- Several new Tuxen ships are in the works.

v1.5.0 - SAExp (Space Arena Expansion)
	Additions
		Ships
			- "Kupoint"
				- The final boss and reward for completing SA. Upgrade from a baccy, a little worse than the Leaf (I think lol).
				- Note to self to credit the guy in the ES Discord that made the ship sprite
		Outfits
			- "Allkey"
				- For description, read "v1.4.1/To Come/Outfits/Allkey"
		Missions
			- Space Arena
				- Boy, am I excited for this. I've got mission, fleet, variant, and event mechanics in the bag. We gucci.
		Fleets
			- Space Arena
				- Added a bunch of ND fleets just so I can add them into the waves. Not sure if I'll even be able to use them all, so does that mean I add all the ships below "Light Warship" and a few "Medium/Heavy Warships"? Idk yet. We'll see. Right now I'm just scrolling down `ships.txt`
		Images
			- Space Arena
				- Found a bunch of assorted stock images that I'll use Paint 3D to edit properly. They WILL replace some existing `images/planet` images etc, and I have a few in mind for the actual space arena `images/ui`, instead of using the Ubuntu logo (although it looks dope, the new image is MUCH simpler and not copyrighted).
	Changes
		Map
			- Space Arena
				- Gave SA more systems, resulting from a UII change. Also means more waves. In fact, there's a total of 18 (!) waves, then a boss fight with a special ship (It won't be sold anywhere. If the player wants the ship (they will) they'll have to make sure to not destroy it. Since it'll be the only ship in the system, it shouldn't be too hard. The ship, then, becomes the trophy of beating SA (alongside the 25,000,000 credits you'll get).).
	To Come
		Map
			- Space Arena
				- Originally wasn't going to, but: personal note to add a refueling station in the Wave 9/10 system. 9 as midway, or 10 as achievement?
		Root Files
			- Plugin Icon
				- Thinking of changing the plugin icon. It doesn't really support what the plugin is about.

v1.4.1
	Changes
		Root Files
			Added an icon for the in-game plugin menu
		Missions
			- Space Arena
				- Made some modifications with the help of Derpy Horse to get the first SA mission working. I can, from there, copy and paste the base text.
		Outfits
			- Photosynthetic Generator
				- Guess I never recorded the change that I made awhile ago. Instead of it having 40.2 energy gen, it has 20.1 energy gen and 20.1 solar collection. Thanks to @Nameson2#0245 for the suggestion.
		Fleets
			- Adding custom fleets for each wave.
		Events
			- Added a test event for a hyperspace link opening, like the FW Deneb stuff.
	To Come
		Ships
			- I don't have proper names yet, but I've come to the conclusion that the Tuxen need more ships. I've got four new sprites to work with.
		Outfits
			- "Allkey"
				- Basically self-descriptive. Combines all the different keys included in the plugin.
		Root Files
			- I will, eventually, separate the SA and Tuxen missions. This means that if someone wants one but not the other, they can (Interrupted my own thought process here. Do I really need to do this? I'm not forcing the player to find the Tuxen, nor fight in Space Arena. I mind as well leave them together. With that said, when I'm done with the plugin, should I merge the SA and Tuxen files into one (such as missions and names)? With THAT said, what about when I create new content for the plugin (Because I'm not going to spread everything out)? If the files were separated, that would mean I could update or create each unique root folder, like so: Swiren Plugin/SA or Tuxen or [New content]/data,images, etc. This means that there's one .zip to download, but several plugins contained within. Or is the fun in having multiple different things in one? Will consider.) (Also, considering the previous, I don't really have any ideas on what I'll do after SA and the Tuxen. Maybe something will jump out at me? But, other than adding ships/outfits (like every other plugin known to man) I don't know what special angle I can work on. The Tuxen were the brainchild of my first attempt at making an outfit, then writing missions, and so forth. SA is the culmination of that knowledge, and a unique take on ES mechanics that I personally haven't yet seen.
		Missions
			- Add a mission, that, even with both plugins separated (Have duplicate mission files), give the Allkey. This requires that both plugins are installed and have been completed (If I do separate the files).
			- Is it possible to add a `landing` sequence that adds the Waves back into their systems, once you've beaten SA? 

v1.4.0 - Space Arena
	Changes
		Map
			- Tuxen space
				- Actually made my own UII for Tuxen space. With the help of Paint 3D, I managed to make it blend in pretty good. Moved the Tuxen space worlds around for the third time but it's finally done.
			- Swiren Station
				- Added the Developer Drive to the station's outfitter. Honestly, I'll probably remove this outfit once I'm done with the plugin, because it's not necessary and only made for my own convienience.
	Additions
		Map
			- Hub World
				- Phase 1 of the Space Arena. I've got the images and most of the know-how to get this process started.
				- Along with the addition of the actual systems for SA, I have a UII set up as well
			- Various Tuxen worlds, just to fill a little bit more of Tuxen space up. Also added the planet where the Leaf is grown, and also a refueling planet
		Root Files
			- Added a Space Arena disclaimer on how it works etc.
		Outfits
			- "Developer Drive"
				- Pretty self-explanatory. Was getting annoyed at traveling to Helheim every time I wanted to test the Tuxen missions.
	Notes
		- Personal reminder to re-do README.txt since I'm adding a whole other aspect to the plugin (the Space Arena). Just incorporate readme and disclaimer? probs make more sense ngl
	To Come
		- Got some feedback on the Tuxen storyline. Looks like I'm going to have to greatly expand the length at which you're introduced to them. Also, mlerp (the tester) hated going to Helheim and back. I thought it made a subtle point, being on the other side of the galaxy, but I guess not. Will probably place it on a Syndicate world. It would make sense for them to keep quiet about the Tuxen, as they make good money from the Tuxen buying weapons from human space.


v1.3.0 - Tuxen Missions
	Changes
		Outfits
			- "Tuxen Biofuel Capsule"
				- Renamed to just "Biofuel Capsule"
		Licenses
			- Made all Tuxen outfits and ships require the Tuxen license, made available after the Tuxen mission chain.
		Map
			- Pushed back all the custom systems just in case an official map update happens in the NE quadrant of the map.
	Additions
		Missions
			- There is finally a mission chain available for Letaga and the Tuxen. It took me forever to figure out (including some unwanted compromise) but the mission chain includes getting the outfit required to get through the Nuclear Wormhole. I'll definitely be adding more content to this, but for now, I'm done. It's 3:21 AM for me right now. I'm tired.
		Outfits
			- "Tuxen License"
			- "Tuxen Spacebender" - Used in place of Nuclear Keystone, may have future use
			- "Biocooler"
			- "Keys 1, 2, and 3" - Will be used in a space arena later, stay tuned
			- "Biochemical Identifier" - used to access rest of Tuxen space
		Ships
			- "Dilapidated Sun Striker" - used by the Shunned Tuxen
		Map
			- "Sagittarius Tuxen Wormhole"
			- "Raywar Tuxen Wormhole"
	To Come
		Missions
			- I'm really starting to get the hang of mission building. So far, I have a short mission chain that introduces you to Bi'tux, a Tuxen scout, on Letaga. You go to Helheim and retrieve a Nuclear Keystone, which gives you access to the initial 'collapsing' wormhole. You then proceed to L'nux for the rest of the intro, which will eventually lead into finding the Shunned Tuxen on Ritala, then reconciling with them. Everyone's happy, yay! After that, you get the Tuxen License. Then you can buy Tuxen outfits and ships. That's the plan so far.
		Ships
			- I, at some point, plan to add outfit variations to the Tuxen fleets. Not sure if I want to do it to the Shunned Tuxen, or just the Sun Strikers, or all of them?
		Hails
			- Just a personal reminder to add Shunned Tuxen hails and the like, to give them a personality.
			
		Map
			- Will be using the Keys and making a space arena of some sort

v1.2.0 - Tuxen Setup
	Additions
		Outfits
			- "Nuclear Keystone" - As of right now, it is impossible to obtain this, as it is sold in Tuxen space. This outfit gives you access to Tuxen space. Catch my drift? (This will be remedied when I write the First Contact missions)
			- "Windscoop"
			- "Small Stomata Thrusters"
			- "Small Stomata Steering"
			- "Large Stomata Thrusters"
			- "Large Stomata Steering"
				- No Medium Stomata because there's really no need
		Map
			- Added so many new systems (with planets to come) that I don't really want to list them all. Besides, it'd be more fun to explore them yourself!
			- This one is the exception to the above - planet "Ritala", where I will have the Shunned Tuxen introduced
	Changes
		Map
			- Redid Swiren Station to only sell the "Top Hat" outfit, and to have the "Basic Ships" shipyard, just so you can sell your own ships
	To Come
		Outfits
			- Considering renaming the Stomata Thrusters to fit some sort of class (like the Korath engines etc). But what would I name them?
		Map
			- Add habitable planets to most of the new systems, but only one that has a spaceport
			- Make system "109846709823" house the extreme endgame outfits - and set up a **fleet** of dilapidated Sun Strikers to fight the player
			- Also make it so missions are required to get objects to land on different wormholes, all leading up to Ritala
			- Tuxen as hive mind? hmm

v1.1.1
	Changes
		Ships
			- Sun Striker
				- Added 100 more outfit space after accidentally making it have -45 outfit space (extra 55 for the versatility aspect) for a total of 305 outfit space
		Governments
			- Tuxen
				- Changed the frequency at which they appear in Tuxenburg, along with how many appear. Also fixed their ship names
		Persons
			- Swiren
				- After finally(!!) finding my custom ship, I realized just how bad I messed up the hail messages. Fixed them, but when I rebooted the game for precache, the ship was gone. We'll never know if I truly fixed it.
		Missions
			- Tuxen Warning
				- Added a line to clarify the warning.
	To Come
		Outfits
			- Since the only thrusters I have now are way too overpowered for the Sun Striker, I'll be making Small thrusters, since the ones now were designed for the Leaf.

v1.1.0 - I Ship It
	Changes
		Ships
			- "Tuxen 'Leaf'"
				- Changed name (again) to just 'Leaf'
	Additions
		Ships
			- Sun Striker
	Notes
		- A big boi thanks to @Nameson2#0245 for general help, and pointing out various plot holes etc.

v1.0.0 - On the Map - First Official Release
	Changes
		Ships
			- "Paos 'Leaf'"
				- Changed name to "Tuxen 'Leaf'"
		Outfits
			- "Paos Biofuel Capsule"
				- Changed name to "Tuxen Biofuel Capsule"
		Governments
			- Renamed the Ca'ti to Paos, then to Tuxen. We'll see how this stays for now.
	Additions
		Map
			- "Tuxenburg" system, with "L'nux" planet
			- "Warden Diamond" system, with "Lilith", "Charon", "Cerberus", and "Medusa" planets
		Governments
			- "Tuxen" government, along with appropriate hails, names, and frequency
			- "Confederacy" government, used in the "Warden Diamond" system. 
				- Read Jack L. Chalker's 'The Four Lords of the Diamond' book to get the reference. (An absolute must-have if you like 1950s-style SF.)
	To Come
		Ships
			- "Sun Striker"

v0.2.0 - Foliage Technology
	Changes
		Ships
			- "Ca'ti Leaf"
				- Balanced the cost.
				- Changed name to "Paos 'Leaf'"
		Outfits
			- "Radial Hex Field"
				- Balanced some of its extra attributes.
			- Balanced the Leaf-specific outfits' costs alongside the Leaf's cost
	Additions
		Outfits
			- "Stomata Thrusters" (Thanks to Ember369 in the ES Discord for the idea)
			- "Photosynthetic Generator"
			- "Bioquadrilateral Shield Generator"
			- "Sequential Solar Array"
			- "Metabolic Waste Battery"
			- "Compressed Dung Storage"
			- "Paos Biofuel Capsule"
		Map
			- "Letaga" - a planet in the Sagittarius A system.
			- "Swiren Station" - a space station above Mars in the Sol system.
		Missions
			- Began the process of introducing the Ca'ti (read the To Come section below). First Contact is on Legata in the Sagittarius A system, although the storyline is as of now nonexistent. Still trying to figure out how to code certain things.
			- Make the Leaf your ultimate reward for the Ca'ti missions? Make them the devs of Leaf? Ca'ti homeworld on that giant forest planet?
	To Come
		Outfits
			- "Stomata Thrusters"
				- Considering making small, medium, and large variations. Might name them after leaves or branches, in respective scaling order.
			- Custom outfits
				- Going to start the transition of moving Leaf and Leaf-specific outfits to Tuxen-label worlds
		Missions
			- Rethinking the "Ca'ti" name. First random idea is "Paos/Paosians." (This is awhile later. Paos is very similar to the Naos system. Not my intent. Next name. Tuxen?)
	
v0.1.1
	Bug Fixes
		Ships
			- "Leaf"
				- Fixed a coding issue where the hardpoints weren't showing up correctly on the ship.
	To Come
		Ships
			- "Leaf"
				- Will lower Leaf price. Mega high right now. 157 million? 
		Outfits
			- Considering making outfits specific to the Leaf.
			- Will lower custom outfit prices (Done)
			- Might look up or make a sound for the Radial Hex Field, to further ensure that yes, it is doing something.
		Map
			- A "Swiren Station" is in the works. Sell custom outfits here, or in alien space?
		Missions
			- New species? Humans? Or a new one altogether? You'd find them through a wormhole at Sagittarius A and only one world out of many would be friendly. Upon landing they'd be like "Help the wormhole's collapsing because of the black hole's gravity, can you help us?" And GET THIS: That guy that wanted 50 qks would publish his findings and it would conveniently show that many of them in one area holds a hyperspace connection together. And the player's kinda like, "huh that's cool."

v0.1.0 - In the Beginning
	Additions
		Ships
			- "Leaf"
		Outfits
			- "Radial Hex Field"
			- "Multipurpose Fractal Engine"
			- "LENS"
			- "Black Box"
			- "The Major"
			- "Top Hat"
		Persons
			- "Swiren"
	To Come
		Ships
			- "Leaf"
				- Working on fixing Leaf hardpoints.
