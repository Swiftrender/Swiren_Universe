			`This planet is desolated; in complete ruin. Apparently, given the craters and terrible atmosphere, the destruction is artificial; but your scanners indicate no sign of life, or even any sign of civilization. However, just to be sure, you could fly to the other side of the planet and make scans there.`

				`	(Head back to your ship and scan the rest of the planet.)`
				`	(Not right now.)
					defer

			`	You begin to head back to your ship when you notice a slightly hidden door in the ground. Covered by layers of dust, you aren't surprised you didn't notice this before. Check it out?`
			choice
				`	(Yes.)`
					goto fc1
				`	(No, continue with your planet scan, then leave.)`
					defer

			`	The door seems to be a simple blast door.`
			choice
				`	(Knock on the door.)`
				`	(Use your pistol and break in.)`
					goto break

			`You knock on the door. After several minutes of waiting, you begin to feel silly.`
			
			label break
			`You opt to use your pistol to blast the door off. Doing so reveals a staircase leading into darkness.`
			` As you descend the staircase, the light level drops considerably even before you're far into the corridor. At the bottom of the longest staircase you feel you've ever encountered, a small, empty room is all that is disappointingly there. However, just to make sure, you take a peek around.`
			` After a few minutes of searching, you are surprised to find a hairline crack in the far wall. It looks too straight to be natural, so you grab a thin metal rod from your spare parts crate. After wedging it in, you use a rubber hammer (also from the parts crate) and tap the wedge in.`
			` The wall crumbles fairly easily, and you're not completely shocked to find a passageway behind -- wait! Was that movement?`
			`As much as you'd rather not inspect it, you muster your courage and venture forth. To your absolute amazement (you let out a slightly girlish scream), a human-sized penguin rushes towards you.`
			` "Human! Human!" it calls.`
			` It's obviously not trying to hurt you, so you reply. "Yes..?"
			` "Human, we need your help! Please, help us!`
			choice
				`	"What do you need?"`
			` "Human, I am part of a species called the Tuxen" it continues, "and we are in dire need. I am sure you have noticed the anomaly near the black hole in this system."`
			choice
				`	"Of course, what is it?"`
				`	"No, I haven't. What is it?"
			` "It is our way home! But the wormhole is collapsing, and it will soon close. The rest of our race is on the other side, and we cannot get through!"`
			choice
				`	"Why is that my problem?"`
				`	"What can I do to help?"`
			` "It will become a problem if you don't help us, human. We need you! There is a world, on the edge of the galaxy, that has a technology that will stabilize the wormhole. Only that will help!"
			` The penguin (a Tuxen, as you recall) seems sincere. You decide then and there that you don't mind helping, and you say so.`
			` "Oh, thank you human! Thank you! I know you must have so many questions, but time is of the essence. When the wormhole has been proven to be stabilized, we will answer your questions. Go to Helheim and retrieve the technology. With utmost haste, please, human!"

				`	"So how did you end up stranded out there?"`
			`	Your question startles him out of his reverie.`
			`	"First, let me give you some background."
			`	"Our race" he begins, "is a mostly peaceful one. We profit off the natural plant life found on most of our worlds. Soon, you'll be able to see that from our outfits and ships. But awhile back there was a group that thought differently. They disagreed with our way of making things. So they began secret mining operations on the other side of the planet. It was years before anyone found them. After that, the group was given the title Shunned, and banished to the stars. From there, we don't know where they went, or even if they're still alive."`
			choice
				`	"Is that how you ended up stranded? The Shunned?"`
			`	"Yes. We were both taken by surprise, but they had the advantage of numbers. In the end they stole my ship and left."`
			choice
				`	"But how does the wormhole fit in to this?"
			`	"Ah. Yes. That is a terrible story to tell, but one I must inform you of."`
			`	"During the peak of the Shunned creations here, they attempted to make an outfit that could send devastating ultrasonic waves out in every direction, having great impacts on ships."`
			`	"One day, they took it too far. A few young and reckless Shunned got in ships and tried to test the weapon out on a test dummy. The results were so fierce, and so uncontrolled, that it made a small tear in the wormhole. Nothing noticeable at first. But repetitive tests of the weapon made the wormhole nearly collapse. Luckily we detected it before it was too late. That's partially why they were banished."`
			choice
				`	"The device I brought back, will that fix it?"`
			`	Bi'tux hesitated a moment before replying.`
			`	"We think so. Now that we are back in Tuxen space, we have access to a particular outfit designed for wormhole travel, called the Spacebender. It's a bit more advanced, allowing you to go through even if all that's left is the ion trail, just in case. With this outfit, you will be able to go back through the wormhole and place the device you retrieved from Helheim into orbit around it. That should hopefully restore it."
			choice
				`	"So why hasn't anyone used this device to restore it yet?"`
			`	Bi'tux laughs.`
			`	"That's what I was going out for! Until my ship was stolen, anyways."`
			`	"Now. Time is still of the essence. Please take a Spacebender for your travel to Letaga, compliments of the Tuxen government. While you place the device, I will go buy a ship, seeing as I still don't have one. Good luck!"`
