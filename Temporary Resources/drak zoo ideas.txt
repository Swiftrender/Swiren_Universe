Drak Zoo

Lots of requirements - main plot, hai first contact, others - will look through mission files of vanilla

Basically, the Hai (unfettered, I think?) that first explained that the galaxy was a zoo with corners for each species controlled by the Drak. It's finally happening to humans - can't fight the Drak (too powerful) so evasion missions like the Remnant gas planet one are necessary. Your goal is to 
	- get enough humans to a respectable quadrant of space?
	- convince the Drak to let us be?
	- defeat the Drak somehow?
		- Multi-race team-up?
			- Could be a potential storyline driver - multiple races, some forced to cooperate with eachother but struggle 
		- Seems most probable

- think of good name - drak zoo kinda suits it
