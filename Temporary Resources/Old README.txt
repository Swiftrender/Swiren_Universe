Detailed Plugin Explanation: This plugin adds various endgame outfits and ships. The intent of these outfits and ships are for when you have completed the majority of the game and just want to explore the map and finish loose storylines. I personally got to a point after the main Free Worlds campaign where I just didn't want to keep running back and forth with jobs, and wanted to get on with the finer points of the game. Obviously, these outfits are somewhat expensive (there's a tiny piece of story as to why, apart from being self-evident in-game) so while you could save edit money or the outfit/ship in, it's more fun to wait until you can really have that self-satisfaction.

The actual outfits themselves are basically other outfits rolled up into one. However, with, say, cooling, you could obviously stack Liquid Helium coolers and it would be better than the one particular outfit with included cooling, but each outfit saves quite a lot of space at the expense of a little less performance.

Included with this plugin is a HTML website file for the official Endless Sky ship builder. I found it incredibly handy during the making of this. It has its own explanation and instructions once you open it.

Again, enjoy the plugin!
